# sddtask
Another (bigger) game made for the SDD course. Made using CPython and pygame.
To run the game, simply double click `run.py`! (a terminal also works).
Works on Windows, Linux and macOS.

Basic controls (explained in game):
- **WASD** to move the player.
- **Space** to activate the jetpack.
- **Shift** to run/sprint.
- **Esc** to pause the game.

Game directory structure:
- `audio/` 	Sound resource files.
- `images/`	Image resource files.
- `levels/`	JSON level files loaded by game and corresponding TMX (Tiled) map files.
- `src/` 	Python source files.
